## 🎯 Overview

This bot automatically trades on Polymarket's 15-minute prediction markets for BTC, ETH, Solana, and XRP. It uses a **momentum-based strategy** that buys tokens when price reaches a trigger threshold after a minimum time has elapsed, then sells at a target price or redeems at market closure.

🎥 Watch the bot in action:

### Core Strategy

**Buy Signal**: When token price reaches `trigger_price` (e.g., $0.87) **after** `min_elapsed_minutes` (e.g., 8 minutes) have passed in the 15-minute period.

**Sell Signal**: 
- Sell at `sell_price` (e.g., $0.98) when price reaches target
- Stop-loss at `stop_loss_price` (e.g., $0.80) if price drops
- Redeem at market closure if token wins (worth $1.00) or loses (worth $0.00)

**Rationale**: If a token reaches $0.87+ after 8+ minutes, there's strong momentum suggesting it will likely reach $0.98+ or $1.00 by market close.

### Trading Flow

```
1. MarketMonitor polls markets every check_interval_ms (default: 1 second)
   ↓
2. PriceDetector analyzes prices:
   - Checks if min_elapsed_minutes have passed
   - Checks if price >= trigger_price
   - Checks if price <= max_buy_price
   - Checks if time_remaining >= min_time_remaining_seconds
   ↓
3. If all conditions met → BuyOpportunity detected
   ↓
4. Trader executes buy order:
   - Places market order (FOK - Fill or Kill)
   - Verifies balance (polls until tokens arrive)
   - Tracks position in pending_trades
   ↓
5. Background task monitors position:
   - Checks if price reached sell_price → Sell
   - Checks if price dropped to stop_loss_price → Sell
   - Checks if market closed → Redeem tokens
   ↓
6. Profit/loss recorded and logged
```

#### Trading Strategy Settings

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `fixed_trade_amount` | USD amount per trade | 4.5 |
| `trigger_price` | Minimum price to trigger buy (e.g., 0.87 = $0.87) | 0.87 |
| `max_buy_price` | Maximum price to buy at (e.g., 0.95 = $0.95) | 0.95 |

| `enable_solana_trading` | Enable Solana market trading | false |
| `enable_xrp_trading` | Enable XRP market trading | false |

#### Market Discovery

The bot automatically discovers markets for each 15-minute period. You can optionally set `condition_id` values in config to use specific markets:

```json
{
  "trading": {
    "btc_condition_id": "0x...",
    "eth_condition_id": "0x...",
    "solana_condition_id": "0x...",
    "xrp_condition_id": "0x..."
  }
}
```

If not set, the bot will automatically discover markets using slug patterns like:
- `btc-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
- `eth-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
- `solana-updown-15m-{timestamp}` or `sol-updown-15m-{timestamp}`
- `xrp-updown-15m-{timestamp}`

---

## 📖 Core Logic Explained

### 1. Market Monitoring

The `MarketMonitor` continuously polls Polymarket API every `check_interval_ms` (default: 1 second) to:
- Fetch current market prices (BID/ASK)
- Calculate time remaining in the 15-minute period
- Generate `MarketSnapshot` with all market data

### 2. Opportunity Detection

The `PriceDetector` analyzes each snapshot and checks:

```rust
// Buy conditions (ALL must be true):
1. time_elapsed >= min_elapsed_minutes (e.g., 8 minutes)
2. bid_price >= trigger_price (e.g., $0.87)
3. bid_price <= max_buy_price (e.g., $0.95)
4. time_remaining >= min_time_remaining_seconds (e.g., 30 seconds)
5. No active position of same token type in this period
6. Reset state is "Ready" (after sell, price must drop below trigger first)
```

**Example Scenario**:
- 8 minutes have elapsed in a 15-minute period
- BTC Up token BID price = $0.88
- 7 minutes remaining (420 seconds > 30 seconds minimum)
- ✅ **Buy signal triggered!**

### 3. Trade Execution

When a buy opportunity is detected:

1. **Order Placement**: Places market order (FOK - Fill or Kill)
   - Order size: `fixed_trade_amount` USD (e.g., $4.50)
   - Type: Market order (immediate execution)
   - Side: BUY

2. **Balance Verification**: Polls balance every 2 seconds (max 60 seconds) until tokens arrive

3. **Position Tracking**: Adds trade to `pending_trades` HashMap:
   ```rust
   PendingTrade {
       token_id: "...",
       purchase_price: 0.88,
       units: 5.11,  // $4.50 / $0.88
       sell_price: 0.98,
       stop_loss_price: 0.80,
       // ... other fields
   }
   ```

### 4. Position Management

Background task (`check_pending_trades()`) runs every 500ms to:

1. **Check Sell Conditions**:
   - If ASK price >= `sell_price` → Place sell order
   - If ASK price <= `stop_loss_price` → Place sell order (stop-loss)

2. **Check Market Closure**:
   - If market closed → Redeem tokens
   - Winning token (correct outcome) = $1.00 per share
   - Losing token (wrong outcome) = $0.00 per share

3. **Retry Logic**:
   - Failed sell orders are retried (up to `sell_attempts` limit)
   - Failed redemptions are retried every 10 seconds

### 5. Reset Mechanism

After a successful buy-sell cycle:
- Price must drop **below** `trigger_price` before allowing another buy
- Prevents buying immediately after selling when price only dips slightly
- Ensures each buy is a fresh opportunity

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Market Periods

- Markets run in **15-minute periods** (900 seconds)
- Each period has a unique timestamp (rounded to nearest 15 minutes)
- New markets are discovered automatically at period boundaries

### Order Types

- **Market Orders (FOK)**: Immediate execution, fill or kill
- **Limit Orders**: Placed at specific price (used for sell orders)

### Token Redemption

- At market closure, winning tokens are worth **$1.00**
- Losing tokens are worth **$0.00**
- The bot automatically redeems tokens after market closure
- Redemption may take a few minutes to process on-chain

### Gas Fees

- Each transaction requires POL/MATIC for gas
- Recommended: Keep at least **0.5 POL** in wallet
- Gas costs vary with network congestion

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Bot not detecting opportunities

- Check `trigger_price` isn't too high
- Verify `min_elapsed_minutes` isn't too long
- Ensure markets are active and not closed
- Check logs for price updates

### Orders failing

- Verify USDC balance is sufficient
- Check POL balance for gas fees
- Ensure API credentials are correct
- Verify wallet has proper allowances

### Authentication errors

- Check `private_key` format (hex string)
- Verify `api_key`, `api_secret`, `api_passphrase` are correct
- Ensure `signature_type` matches your wallet type
- Check `proxy_wallet_address` if using proxy wallet

### Market discovery failing

- Markets may not exist for all periods
- Check Polymarket website for active markets
- Set `condition_id` manually in config if needed
- Bot will use fallback markets if discovery fails
